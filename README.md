# AI Task Distribution System

> 🚧 **PROTOTYPE** - This is a demonstration of AI task distribution concepts

## About

This prototype demonstrates how complex tasks can be automatically distributed across multiple AI agents. It provides a visual demonstration of task breakdown, agent assignment, and real-time progress monitoring.

## Demo

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Create a new task using the form
3. Watch as the system:
   - Analyzes and breaks down the task
   - Assigns subtasks to specialized agents
   - Shows real-time progress updates

## Features

- 🤖 4 Specialized AI Agents (Research, Writing, Code, Analysis)
- 📊 Real-time Progress Visualization
- 🔄 Automatic Task Breakdown
- 📈 Agent Performance Metrics

## Technical Notes

- Browser-based prototype using HTML/JavaScript
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Simulated AI agent behavior
- No installation or setup required

## Future Development

This prototype could be extended with:
- Real AI model integration
- Backend services
- Database storage
- Advanced task analysis
- Multi-user support
- Security features

## License

MIT - Use this prototype as inspiration for your own implementation.
